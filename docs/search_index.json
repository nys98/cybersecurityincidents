According to the FBI, the number of reported cybercrime incidents rose by about 300% in 2020 within the US alone. This does not come as a surprise since the COVID-19 pandemic provided the impetus for digital migration, which naturally leads to an increased financial incentive for hackers. Coincidentally, there has been an uptick in the use of cyber attacks by nation states fueled by the rise in geopolitical tensions between countries. Disruptions brought about by such incidents of cyber warfare are a cause of concern given their scale. Our project will investigate high-impact cyber attacks and incidents on government agencies, defense and high tech companies, or economic crimes with losses of more than a million dollars, retrieved from the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies: https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents. 1.2 Data availability The data we will be using comes from the website mentioned above, from which one can download a PDF text file 221006_Significant_Cyber_Incidents.pdf containing all the major cyber attacks from 2003 to present. Using regex and natural language processing, we can extract the following features: time of attack, origin of attacker, origin of victim, type of attack and the industry affected. 1.3 Motivation This project aims to gain a deeper understanding on the cyber incidents listed in the report. Specifically, we will look for methods to group the attacker and victim origin countries (e.g. by continent or GDP per capita) for analysis.

Of which, cybersecurity has rightfully gained significant attention in today’s digital age. A list of the most significant cybersecurity incidents from 2003 are provided based on research by the CSIS Strategic Technologies Program. These incidents involve cyber attacks on government agencies, defense and high tech companies, or crimes with over a million dollars in losses. Attacks of such scale usually require significant resources and cyber offensive capabilities, and they can mostly be attributed to the work of nation states. A sample of the transgressions obtained from the report are shown in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Sample data from CSIS Cybersecurity Incidents Report The following information can be obtained from each incident: Time of Incident Hacker Origin Victim Origin Type of Hack Industry Targeted In some instances, the hacker origin, type of hack or industry targeted are not immediately obvious from the description provided (e.g. second to last incident in Figure 3.1) and will be labeled with “Unknown” in the subsequent data extraction process. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Significant efforts have been put into extracting all incidents from the report and labeling each feature based on the description of the hack. These two steps were done in Python for the ease of using established Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to automate the process. The links to the Jupyter notebooks used in the two steps can be found below: Incident Extraction NLP Feature Prediction 3.2.1 Incident Extraction Most of the incidents were successfully identified by the set of regular expressions in the notebook. However, a small number of these incidents were either split into two or combined with the previous incident. They were identified by manually inspecting the csv file obtained from running the code in the notebook. 3.2.2 NLP Feature Prediction There are a total of over 900 incidents detailed in the report. Labeling each incident manually with all the features will take a significant amount of time. Instead, a subset of the actual data was labeled and used to train an NLP model to predict each feature for the remaining incidents. 200 incidents were labeled with the previously identified features. Of which, 150 was used to train and validate the NLP model, with the remaining 50 used to evaluate the performance of the model. Separate sets of model weights were used to predict each feature. The BERT model was trained to predict the best answer from a list of multiple choice options. Each model was trained until it achieved at least 80% accuracy on the hidden evaluation data. 3.3 Missing value analysis A value is considered missing if it is labeled Unknown by the NLP model. The graphs above show that the two columns with the largest number of missing values are hacker_origin and hacktype, with close to 35% of the rows missing the information. A sample of the incidents with both features missing is shown below: ## [1] &quot;August 2016. A group calling itself â\\u0080\\u009cShadow Brokersâ\\u0080\\u009d claimed to have penetrated NSA and published a collection of NSA tools on Pastebin. &quot; ## [2] &quot;April 2017. The Shadow Brokers, the group that claimed to have hacked the NSA in August 2016, released yet another trove of purported NSA hacking tools, in cluding one that suggests the NSA had gained access to SWIFT messages. &quot; ## [3] &quot;March 2017. Wikileaks released a trove of sophisticated CIA hacking tools dated from 2013 to 2016, claiming that the release reflected several hundred million lines of CIA -developed code. &quot; ## [4] &quot;October 2010. Public facing networks run by NASDAQ, as well as an information sharin g application called Directors Desk, are compromised by an unknown external group. NASDAQ says it is unsure how far hackers might have penetrated into their network. &quot; ## [5] &quot;November 2014. A report by the University of Toronto finds that human rights organizations are routinely hacked by foreign intelligence services, using readily available crime ware as well as specially designed programs, with intrusion lasting for y ears. &quot; It is clear that the descriptions presented in the report do not always reveal the origin of the hacker nor the type of hack that occurred. A more interesting observation is that a handful of incidents have unknown victim_origin in addition to both hacker_origin and hacktype: ## [1] &quot;February 2022. Since October 2021, a hacking group targeted Palestinian individuals and organizations with malware. Researchers suggest that the operat ion could be connected to a broader campaign by a hacking group commonly attributed to the cyber arm of Hamas that started in 2017. &quot; ## [2] &quot;May 2017. A ransomware campaign spread to 99 countries using a vulnerability revealed in the Shadow Brokersâ\\u0080\\u0099 April 2017 dump of NSA tools. &quot; ## [3] &quot;April 2017. The Shadow Brokers, the group that claimed to have hacked the NSA in August 2016, released yet another trove of purported NSA hacking tools, in cluding one that suggests the NSA had gained access to SWIFT messages. &quot; Palestine was not provided as an option for the NLP model to select from and hence it was not predicted. The second and third incidents involved multiple unspecified countries and the NSA respectively, in which the model was not able to attribute to the US. The analysis above show that the reported incidents sometimes lack valuable information on the features of interest. It is important to keep this fact in mind when attempting to visualize the data. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Temporal Analysis of Cybersecurity Incidents 4.2 Hacker and Victim Analysis 4.3 Type of Cyber Attack 4.4 Targeted Industries", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Temporal Analysis of Cybersecurity Incidents There is a clear upward trend in the number of significant cyber-related incidents around the world over the years. Prior to 2017, the total number of incidents did not exceed fifty per year. Within a short span of three years, this number approximately doubled from 70 in 2017 to 140 in 2020. In 2021, the number of recorded incidents bucked the trend and fell by over 50 cases from 2020. This could be because of the increased awareness of the importance of good cyber hygiene with additional resources and measures to strengthen cybersecurity globally. Note that the data for 2022 consists of incidents from January to September 2022. This value has also marginally surpassed three quarters of the total number of incidents in 2021. This could mean that the peak in 2020 was an anomaly, but still gives credence to the rising trend in number of cybersecurity incidents worldwide. From the line graph, there are also unusually high peaks in the number of incidents, both in May 2013 and October 2020. From the bar plot, October 2020 has a rather high number of attacks against the United States. There might be some correlation with the Presidential Elections of 2020. On the other hand, the attacks in May 2013 were not disproportionately directed towards any particular country, so it is unlikely that any single major world event caused the spike in number of incidents. 4.2 Hacker and Victim Analysis Using a reasonable cutoff = 50, we can see the major attackers over the years. The majority of attacks were from unknown sources, which makes sense as there are numerous private organizations and individuals that carry out cyberattacks. Following which, cyberattacks were attributed to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea in decreasing number of incidents. The aggregated attacks carried out by other governments fall between the number of Iranian and North Korean attacks. These statistics seem to be in line with the reports of Western media. Using a reasonable cutoff = 30, we can see the major victims over the years. We can see that the majority of attacks are on the “Other” category of countries, suggesting that cyberattacks are relatively spread out across many countries. Still, the next highest number is the United States, followed by a sharp drop in number for unknown victims (non-country specific) followed by other individual countries such as India, Iran, the UK, Israel, Ukraine and China. The same data obtained previously can be represented with a Cleveland Dot Plot as shown above. By combining the total number of times each country was on the offensive and the number of times each country was hacked on the above plot, it is clear that some countries like China, Russia and Iran are more proactive in directing cyberattacks with many more attacks originating from them than against them while others like the United States and India orchestrated much fewer number of attacks vis-a-vis the number of times they were victims of these hacks. 4.3 Type of Cyber Attack This graph shows the types of attacks carried out. Most are unknown, after which data exfiltration and malware are the next most common. Next, we try to categorize the victims and attack types into fewer categories, and apply an alluvial diagram between the combination of attacker, hacktype and victim to see if there are any patterns that can be identified. The rationale to use an alluvial diagram is that a cybersecurity incident could be viewed as a chronological flow, where the idea of attacking originates from a source country (attacker), moves to the specific type of attack, then flows to a victim country. The chart is messy and has too many groups, which makes it hard to see any patterns. We can try with geom_flow, but most likely it would be better to do a pairwise comparison. The alluvial diagram for hacktype and attacker seems to show some differences in choice of attack for different countries. Iran, North Korea, Others and Unknown origin seem to choose attack types that are rather similar to the overall proportion of attack types (i.e. most of their attack types are unknown, followed by data exfiltration, other, and malware). However, the largest source of cyberattacks, China, heavily favors data exfiltration. On the other hand, Russia has a large percentage of Unknown and Other types of hacktypes, and a very small proportion of data exfiltration in comparison. Most of the flows from attacker to victim seem to be in line with the overall proportion, but China and Unknown attackers seem to have a slightly higher chance of targeting the United States. Finally, the hacktype to victim alluvial diagram shows a roughly equal spread of each attack type targeting the victim countries, but data exfiltration seems to appear slightly more for the United States. 4.4 Targeted Industries Finally, when we look at the industries targeted, the largest number of incidents target governments followed by defense. This fact suggests that majority of cyber incidents are politically motivated. On a global scale, governments have to strengthen their policies and technical abilities in order to protect their digital assets from malicious actors. There were over 50 incidents that involved companies in the finance industry, which shows that cyber criminals are also driven to hack others due to potential financial gains.

We extracted the date of attack, attacker, victim, hacktype and industry using natural language processing (NLP). We were able to see the general increasing trend of attacks from 2003 to 2022, and identify some months where cyberattack activity peaked (May 2013 and October 2020). Next, we explored the attack origin and victim countries, and found that the single countries where most attacks originated from were China, Russia and Iran, whereas the most targeted country for cyberattacks was the United States. We also noted that the type of attacks used were mostly unknown, followed by data exfiltration and malware. To see how the cyberattacks flowed from source to victim, we attempted to visualize with alluvial diagrams, which gave some information on the differences in proportion for the different types of cyberattacks. Finally, we looked at the industries targeted and found out that government organizations were highly targeted, followed by defense and energy. 6.2 Limitations The main limitation of this project was the format of our data, which made it slightly difficult for the NLP algorithm to extract information sometimes. This may have caused some inaccuracies for certain data points, and some information may have been lost as well.
