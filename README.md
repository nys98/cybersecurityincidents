This project will investigate cybersecurity incidents reported on the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), retrieved from https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents. Using data visualization, we will attempt to identify patterns and generate some insights.

This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/EDAVtemplate.
